      <p>
        One registration per person is sufficient. Please do not register with
        multiple mobile numbers or different Photo ID Proofs for same
        individual.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scheduling of Second dose should be done from the same account (same
        mobile number) from which the first dose has been taken, for generation
        of final certificate. Separate registration for second dose is not
        necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please carry the registered mobile phone and the requisite documents,
        including appointment slip, the Photo ID card used for registration,
        Employment Certificate (HCW/FLW) etc., while visiting the vaccination
        center, for verification at the time of vaccination.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please check for additional eligibility conditions, if any, prescribed
        by the respective State/UT Government for vaccination at Government
        Vaccination Centers, for 18-44 age group, and carry the other prescribed
        documents (e.g. Comorbidity Certificate etc.) as suggested by respective
        State/UT (on their website)
      </p>
      <p>
        The slots availability is displayed in the search (on district, pincode
        or map) based on the schedule populated by the DIOs (for Government
        Vaccination Centers) and private hospitals for their vaccination
        centers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The vaccination schedule published by DIOs and private hospitals
        displays the list of vaccination centers with the following information
        <br />
        i) The vaccine type. <br />
        ii) The age group (18-44/45+ etc.). <br />
        iii) The number of slots available for dose 1 and dose 2. <br />
        iv) Whether the service is Free or Paid (Vaccination is free of cost at
        all the Government Vaccination Centers). <br />
        v) Per dose price charged by a private hospital. <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are seeking 1st dose vaccination, the system will show you only
        the available slots for dose 1. Similarly, if you are due for 2nd dose,
        the system will show you the available slots for dose 2 after the
        minimum period from the date of 1st dose vaccination has elapsed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a session has been published by the DIO/ private hospital, the
        session now can not be cancelled. However, the session may be
        rescheduled. In case you have booked an appointment in any such
        vaccination session that is rescheduled for any reason, your appointment
        will also be automatically rescheduled accordingly. You will receive a
        confirmation SMS in this regard. On such rescheduling, you would still
        have the option of cancelling or further rescheduling such appointment.
