      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Vaccination Centres provide for a limited number of on-spot
          registration slots every day. Beneficiaries aged 45 years and above
          can schedule appointments online or walk-in to vaccination centres.
          Beneficiaries aged 18 years and above can schedule appointments online
          or walk-in to Government vaccination centres. However, beneficiaries
          aged 18-44 years should mandatorily register themselves and schedule
          appointment online before going to a Private vaccination centre. In
          general, all beneficiaries are recommended to register online and
          schedule vaccination in advance for a hassle-free vaccination
          experience.
